4. Features (with short explanations)
🔹 Core Features (MVP)

Budgeting & Goal Planner

Helps users set financial goals (travel fund, emergency fund, retirement, etc.).

AI estimates how much to save monthly.

AI Risk Profiling

Quick questionnaire to classify user risk appetite (Low, Moderate, High).

Based on this, app suggests suitable instruments (e.g., low-risk debt MF vs equity MF).

Automated SIPs (Systematic Investment Plans)

User sets ₹500–₹2000 monthly investments into mutual funds.

Auto-debited & tracked via app.

Every spend is rounded up to nearest ₹10/₹50.

Extra amount gets invested automatically.

Example: Spend ₹93 → round to ₹100 → ₹7 invested.

Gamification & Education

Streaks for consistent saving.

Badges like “3-month SIP Warrior” or “Emergency Fund Builder.”

Micro-learning videos in local languages (“What is SIP?”, “What is Inflation?”).

🔹 Future / Advanced Features

5. Market & Money Model
Market Opportunity 📈

India’s mutual fund AUM: ₹58+ Lakh Crores (2025).

Retail investor base growing rapidly, but penetration still <10%.

Middle class = biggest untapped segment.

Revenue Model 💰

Freemium Tier (Free): Budgeting + Goal planner + Education.

Premium Tier (₹50/month): Automated SIPs, Roundups, Portfolio tracking.

6. Financial Summary (Basic Estimate)

Initial Build Cost (student-level MVP / prototype): ₹1–2 Lakhs (basic app, AI model = rule-based + APIs).

Operational Costs (servers, integrations, licensing): ₹50,000–1 Lakh / month (if scaled).

Revenue Potential:

1 Lakh users paying ₹50/month → ₹50 Lakhs / month revenue.

Break-even point: Need ~20,000–30,000 paying users to cover costs sustainably.

7. Challenges (Critical View)

Regulatory Issues (SEBI licensing for financial advice).

Trust Deficit (why choose us over Zerodha, Groww, Paytm Money).

High CAC (Customer Acquisition Cost) → must rely on community + referrals.

Technical Complexity (bank integrations, brokerage partnerships).

8. Strategy / Roadmap

Step 1 (MVP):

Build budgeting + goal + education + gamification.

No actual money handling → just simulations + awareness.

Step 2 (Lite Product):

Integrate SIP with 1–2 partner mutual funds.

Add roundups + automation.
