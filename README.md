Concept: Players must guess a randomly generated "code" (a sequence of numbers or letters) based on hints like "X numbers correct" or "X in the correct position" (similar to Mastermind).

Mechanics:
Players have a limited number of tries.
The code changes every time, making each round different.
Offer varying difficulties with longer codes or more complex character sets.

<h2>How the game works:</h2>
A random 4-digit code is generated.
The player enters their guess.
The game checks the player's guess and provides two pieces of feedback:
How many digits are correct but in the wrong position.
How many digits are both correct and in the correct position.
The game ends when the player guesses the code correctly or runs out of attempts.
